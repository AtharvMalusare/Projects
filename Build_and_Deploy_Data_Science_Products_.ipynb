        "**language translation** has always been a tough nut to crack. What makes it tough is the variations in structure and lexicon when one traverses from one language to the other. For this reason the problem of automated language translation or Machine translation has fascinated and inspired the best minds. Over the past decade some trailblazing advances have happened within this field. We have now reached a stage where machine translation has become quite ubiquitous. These technologies are now embedded in all our devices, mobiles, watches, desktops, tablets etc and have become an integral part of our every day life. A common example is the **Google Translate service** which has the capability to identify our input languge and subsequently translate it to multitudes of languages.\n",

In such a scenario the best bet would be to look for all the words which start with ‚ÄúB‚Äù and choose the word which is most frequent. Let us say the most frequent word starting with ‚ÄúB‚Äù is the word ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù. So the next character which will be predicted would be the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù. Now let us imagine that we started looking at all the characters which preceeds B. Given the information about the preceeding charachters ‚ÄúH‚Äù,‚ÄùA‚Äù,‚ÄùP‚Äù,‚ÄùP‚Äù,‚ÄùY‚Äù ‚ÄúB‚Äù, then the probability of predicting ‚Äòi‚Äô would be the highest since the word ‚ÄúBirthday‚Äù is the most likely word given the context ‚ÄúHappy B‚Äù . This is where the concept of context becomes very significant. Language translation depends a lot on the context and therefore there was the need to adopt an architecture where context was learned. Sequence to sequence models like RNNs became an obvious choice."

Each of the time steps receives an input represetend as the arrow pointing upwards. In this context each letter in the string becomes the input at each time step. With each character input the output or the prediction is represented at the top. So given the letter ‚ÄòH‚Äô the prediction is the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô. Once the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô is predicted it becomes the next input and we need to predict the next letter given the context that we had the letter ‚ÄòH‚Äô at the previous time step.

These scenarios are called exploding gradients and vanishing gradients respectively. So in practice a RNN can only leaverage few time steps to extract the context.

However if we look at our corpus of both English and German sentences the lengths of each sentence will vary. We need to adopt a strategy for standardizing this length. One common strategy would be to adopt the maximum length of all the sentences as the standard sequence. Sentences which will have length lesser than the maximum length will have its indexes filled with zeros.However one pitfall of this strategy is, processing will be expensive. Let us say the length of the biggest sentence is 50 and most of the other sentences are of length ranging from 8 to 12. We have a situation wherein for just one sentence we unnecessarily increase the length of all other sentences by filling dummy values. When data sets become large, having all sentences standardized to the longest sentence will make the computation expensive.\r\n",
