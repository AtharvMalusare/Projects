        "\n",
        "**language translation** has always been a tough nut to crack. What makes it tough is the variations in structure and lexicon when one traverses from one language to the other. For this reason the problem of automated language translation or Machine translation has fascinated and inspired the best minds. Over the past decade some trailblazing advances have happened within this field. We have now reached a stage where machine translation has become quite ubiquitous. These technologies are now embedded in all our devices, mobiles, watches, desktops, tablets etc and have become an integral part of our every day life. A common example is the **Google Translate service** which has the capability to identify our input languge and subsequently translate it to multitudes of languages.\n",

        "**Machine translation** technologies have transcended different approaches before reaching the state we are in at present. Let us take a quick look at the evolution of the solution landscape of machine translation.\n",

        "The journey to the current state of the art translation technologies tells a fascinating tale of the strides in machine learning.\n",

        "The evolution of machine translation can be demarcated to three distinct phase. Let us look at each one of them and understand its distinct characteristics."

Every language has such structural charachteristics inherent in them. Transfer methods looks at tapping the structural differences between different language pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the direct method where there is word to word tranlation followed by re-ordering, transfer methods relies on codification of the contrastive knowledge i.e difference between languages, for translation from the source to the target language. Similar to the direct method, this method also relies on deep domain knowledge and codification of complex rules governing language construction.\n"
