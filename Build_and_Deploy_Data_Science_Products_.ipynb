        "**language translation** has always been a tough nut to crack. What makes it tough is the variations in structure and lexicon when one traverses from one language to the other. For this reason the problem of automated language translation or Machine translation has fascinated and inspired the best minds. Over the past decade some trailblazing advances have happened within this field. We have now reached a stage where machine translation has become quite ubiquitous. These technologies are now embedded in all our devices, mobiles, watches, desktops, tablets etc and have become an integral part of our every day life. A common example is the **Google Translate service** which has the capability to identify our input languge and subsequently translate it to multitudes of languages.\n",

        "The journey to the current state of the art translation technologies tells a fascinating tale of the strides in machine learning.\n",

        "The evolution of machine translation can be demarcated to three distinct phase. Let us look at each one of them and understand its distinct characteristics."
