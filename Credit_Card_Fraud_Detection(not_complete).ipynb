        "In the current generation, with high-end technology, still, on every 100 credit card transactions, 13% are falling into the fraudulent activities reported by the creditcards website.\n",

        "A survey paper mentioned that in the year 1997, 63% of companies experienced one fraud in the past two years, and in another year 1999, 57% of companies experienced at least one fraud in the last one year. \n",

But here they must and should be experts in this field or domain, and also the team should have knowledge of how frauds occur in particular domains. This requires more resources, such as people's effort and time.\n",
